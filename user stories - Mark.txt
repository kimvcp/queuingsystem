As a bank customer
I want to be able to book a position in the queue online
so that when I arrive at the bank I won't have to wait as long.

As a bank customer
I want to be notified when my turn in the queue is upcoming
so that I can get to the bank in time for my turn.

As a bank customer
I want to see a estimated waiting time for the queue
so that I can judge how much time I have until my turn.

As a bank clerk
I want to be able to skip people that don't show up
so that I don't have to wait and can move on to the next customer.
