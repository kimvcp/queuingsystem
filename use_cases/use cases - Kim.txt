Use Case - Fix bugs
step 1: Developer find a reason and solution to your bug.
step 2: Developer creates a new hotfix branch in your repository.
step 3: Developer fixes the bug of the application, adds, commits, and pushes the hotfix branch to the repository. 
step 4: Developer open pull request in Github.
step 5: Developer check whether if the system shows conflicts or not. 
    step 5a: If the system shows conflicts, then the developer has to solve them first and notify other members that it is ready to be merged.
