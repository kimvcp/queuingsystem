As a developer
I want to work many feature in the same time without related to another.
So that if I have many branch, I can do a different feature in any branch.

(Branching)
As a developer
I want to create a new branch so that I can do more than 1 work.

(Pushing)
As a developer
I want to push my code to the repository.
so that if I push it to each branch, it will not effect to other feature.

(Merging)
As a developer
I want to combine all feature together
so that if it has a conflicts, I can know and fix it before merge.

Use case - work many feature
step1: check that your application has how many feature.
step2: create a new branch for any feature in your repository.
step3: finished your work on each branch and push it to the repo.
step4: merge all feature branch into master branch.
