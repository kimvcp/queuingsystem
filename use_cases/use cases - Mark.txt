(CLONE)
As a developer
I want to be able to work on my machine locally
so that when I make changes for testing they will not affect everyone else.

Primary Actor: Developer A
Secondary Actor: N/A

NF1: Developer A selects the repo to clone to machine
NF2: Repo clones to machine sucessfully
	AF2.a: Cloning is interuppted by the user
		AF2.a.1: System cancels cloning and removes files
		AF2.a.2: Return to NF1
	EF2.b: Machine doesn't have enough space
		EF2.b.1: System cancels cloning and removes files
		EF2.b.2: Notify Developer A of issue
		EF2.b.3: Return to NF1

Success Condition: All the files from the repo are cloned to the devlopers machine.
Failure Condition: The repo wasn't completely cloned or failed to clone to the machine.

(MERGE)
As a developer
I want to be able to combine my work together and show conflicts
so that I dont have to manually scan all lines of code.

Primary Actor: Developer A
Secondary Actor: N/A

NF1: Developer A checks out the branch they want to mearge to
NF2: Developer A mearges a second branch to the checked out branch
NF3: System mearges the branches sucessfully
	AF3.a: The mearge has conflicts
	AF3.b: System notifys Developer A of conflicts
	AF3.c: Developer A resolves conflict by modifying code
		AF3.c.1: Developer A commits changes
		AF3.c.2: Return to NF3
	AF3.d: Developer A doesn't resolve conflicts and cancels
		AF3.d.1: Return to NF2
	EF3.e: Git closes unexpectedly 
		EF3.e.1: Changes are not made
		EF3.e.2: Return to NF2

Success Condition: Branches are mearged with the correct changes.
Failure Condition: The branches are not mearged.

(PULL)
As a developer
I want to check my code is up to date
so that I don't implement changes that are already implemented.

Primary Actor: Developer A
Secondary Actor: N/A

NF1: Developer A Pulls from the working branch
NF2: The code on the local machine is up to date.
NF3: There's no conflicts and the pull is successful
	AF3.a: The mearge has conflicts
	AF3.b: System notifys Developer A of conflicts
	AF3.c: Developer A resolves conflict by modifying code
		AF3.c.2: Return to NF3
	AF3.d: Developer A doesn't resolve conflicts and cancels
		AF3.d.1: Return to NF1
	EF3.e: Git closes unexpectedly 
		EF3.e.1: Changes are not made
		EF3.e.2: Return to NF1

Success Condition: The code on the developers machine is updated or they're informed there was no changes.
Failure Condition: The code was out of date and failed to updated.
