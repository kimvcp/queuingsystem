As a developer
I want to be able to work on my machine locally
so that when I make changes for testing they will not affect everyone else.

Primary Actor: Developer
Secondary Actor: N/A

NF1: User selects the repo to clone to machine
NF2: Repo clones to machine sucessfully
	AF2.a: Cloning is interuppted by the user
		AF2.a.1: System cancels cloning and removes files
		AF2.a.2: Return to NF1
	EF2.b: Machine doesn't have enough space
		AF2.b.1: System cancels cloning and removes files
		EF2.b.2: Notify User of issue
		EF2.b.3: Return to NF1

Success Condition: All the files from the repo are cloned to the devlopers machine.
Failure Condition: The repo wasn't completely cloned or failed to clone to the machine.


As a developer
I want to be able to combine my work together and show conflicts
so that I dont have to manually scan all lines of code.

Secondary Actor: N/A

NF1: User selects the branch they want to mearge
NF2: User mearges the branch to the 2nd branch
NF3: System mearges the branches sucessfully

	AF3.b: System notifys user of conflicts
	AF3.c: User resolves conflict by modifying code
		AF3.c.1: User commits changes
		AF3.c.2: Return to NF3
	AF3.d: User doesn't resolve conflicts and cancels
		EF3.d.1: Return to NF2
	EF3.e: Git closes unexpectedly 
		EF3.e.1: Changes are not made
		EF3.e.2: Return to NF2
