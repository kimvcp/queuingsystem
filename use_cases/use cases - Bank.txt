(BRANCHING)
As a developer
I want to be able to work on a project feature without confronting code conflicts too frequent.
So that I could work freely with less interuption.

Instruction:

1. Create your own branch
    git branch BRANCHNAME
2. Move to your branch
    git checkout BRANCHNAME
3. Work freely as you wish

(GRAPH)
As a developer
I want to see commit history and see code changes in each commit.
So that when I accidentally delete the code it could be restore in the history.

This can be solve easily because github stores all commit history in a tree branch.
The command is "git log".
There are some modifications for the command such as: --graph, --oneline, --decorate.

(PULLING)
As a developer
I want to make my code up to date with the master branch.
So that when I push the code there wouldn't be any conflicts.

This can be easily solve because there is a command that handle this.
The command is "git pull".
Local git will pull the latest code from the online git to replace the local one.
